# Voter Registration Platform


## Problem Statement
Kenyan citizens have always been frustrated by the long queues during elections. An extreme effect of this is low voter turnouts on election days.  
In an attempt to build a voting system, we saw it right to start with a digital registration platform. This project builds a voter registration platform that will allow digital registration of voters in preparation for general elections.

## Project features

- Display total number of voters per polling station in the home page
- Allow for voter registration through filling and submitting form
- Voter can search theie details by ID Number
- Voter can edit details.
- Voter can unregister as a voter by deleting details.
- Display names of registered voters for a polling station when a polling station is clicked.
- Redirects according to which action has been taken.

## User Stories
- As a user, I should be able to register as a voter by providing details.    
- As a user, I should be able to search for my details by ID number.    
- As a user, I should be able to edit my details upon searching by ID number.    
- As a user, I should be able to unregister as a voter by deleting my details.   
- As a user, I should be able to see the voters registered in a polling station by clicking on a polling station.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
